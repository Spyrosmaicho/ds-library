# ds-library
A collection of fundamental data structures implemented in C, including stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more. Each structure is modular, well-documented, and accompanied by usage examples and test cases. Useful for learning, practice, or as a personal library for future projects.

## How to Run

1) To run the program, first go to the run folder:
```sh
cd run
```

2) Secondly, you change the name of the data structure you want in the Makefile. So if you want to run the vector test cases you should change this line `OBJS = ../src/jason.o ../tests/jason_test.o` using the word vector instead of jason.

3) Next, you should use the following line:
```sh
./run.sh
```
If compilation or execution is not possible, first run:
```sh
chmod +x run.sh
```
